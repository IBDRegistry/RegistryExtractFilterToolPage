      <h1>Registry Extract Filter Tool</h1>

      <p>  
        To help trusts transition to the IBD Registry's new consent system we've developed a tool to separate those who have updated their consent from those who haven't so you don't have to.

        <h2>Is this IG compliant?</h2>
        <p>
          All processing happens on your machine so no data ever leaves your trust.
        </p>

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Does this cover National Opt Out?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, a National Opt Out file of opted-in patients can be optionally included as part of the process. After the 31st March this will become mandatory.
        </p>

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Why a desktop application?</h2>
        <p>
          When deciding how to solve this problem it was important that any solution was implemented with IG compliance in mind. <br>
          Unlike a web application, no data ever leaves the machine ensuring IG compliance.

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>How do I know I can trust this?</h2>
        <p>
          This is an official product designed and built in-house by the IBD Registry. The program has also been digitally signed by DigiCert so you check the signature is a IBD Registry approved release.
        </p>

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>How do I install this?</h2>
        <p>
          The program is supplied as a single file "portable" program. It doesn't need to be installed; you can run it as soon as you download it. <br>
          It is recommended that you store it in a rememberable location so you can find it in future.
